### What is Monkey?

Monkey is a programming language that *you can build yourself* by reading
through <a href="https://interpreterbook.com">Writing An Interpreter In Go</a>
and <a href="https://compilerbook.com">Writing A Compiler In Go</a>.

There is no official implementation of Monkey â€” it lives in these books and it's
up to you, the reader, to implement it. First as a tree-walking interpreter,
then as a bytecode compiler and virtual machine.

Here is what Monkey looks like:

```javascript
// Integers & arithmetic expressions...
let version = 1 + (50 / 2) - (8 * 3);

// ... and strings
let name = "The Monkey programming language";

// ... booleans
let isMonkeyFastNow = true;

// ... arrays & hash maps
let people = [{"name": "Anna", "age": 24}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 99}];
```

It also has functions!

```javascript
// User-defined functions...
let getName = fn(person) { person["name"]; };
getName(people[0]); // => "Anna"
getName(people[1]); // => "Bob"

// and built-in functions
puts(len(people))  // prints: 2
```

And it has conditionals, implicit and explicit returns and recursive functions,
which means we can do this in Monkey:

```javascript
let fibonacci = fn(x) {
  if (x == 0) {
    0
  } else {
    if (x == 1) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2);
    }
  }
};
```

But the crown jewel in every Monkey implementation are closures:

```javascript
// `newAdder` returns a closure that makes use of the free variables `a` and `b`:
let newAdder = fn(a, b) {
    fn(c) { a + b + c };
};
// This constructs a new `adder` function:
let adder = newAdder(1, 2);

adder(8); // => 11
```

    <a href="https://interpreterbook.com"><img src="/images/waiig_cover.png" class="cover border float-right mb-2 ml-4" alt="Cover for Writing An Interpreter In Go"></a>
    <a href="https://interpreterbook.com">Writing An Interpreter In Go</a> was published in <b>2016</b>, its latest version (1.6) was released in 2019.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first book in the Monkey Canon defines the syntax of Monkey and
    describes its implementation as a tree-walking interpreter with the
    following features:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Integers, booleans, strings, arrays, hash maps</li>
    <li>A REPL</li>
    <li>Arithmetic expressions</li>
    <li>Let statements</li>
    <li>First-class and higher-order functions</li>
    <li>Built-in functions</li>

    <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/lost">The Lost Chapter: A Macro System For Monkey</a> was published in <b>2017</b> as a free (to read online or download) addition to <i>Writing An Interpreter In Go</i>.
  <p/>

  <p>It can be thought of as <i>Writing An Interpreter In Go</i>'s fifth chapter,
  since builds directly upon the previous four chapters and extends the Monkey interpreter
  as it stands at the end of the book.</p>

  <p><i>The Lost Chapter: A Macro System For Monkey</i> adds a fully-working Lisp-style <b>macro system</b> to Monkey, that's close to the way Elixir's macro system works.</p>

  <p/>

  <p>
  This book is the sequel to <i>Writing An Interpreter In Go</i> and while it
  does not change its syntax and does not add any features, it changes the
  implementation of Monkey from a tree-walking interpreter into a bytecode
  compiler and virtual machine.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of the book, Monkey looks and behaves exactly as it did at the end
    of <i>Writing An Interpreter In Go</i>, except that <i>it's 3x faster!</i>
  </p>

### Monkeys In The Wild

Some readers love to take little detours when following along with the books: a
different implementation language, new features, a little twist on the syntax.

And since the code that's presented in the books is MIT licensed, everybody's
free to turn their Monkey implementation into whatever their imagination comes
up with and showcase it to the rest of the world.

Collected here are some of those interesting and cool Monkey implementations
readers have shared with me.

  The SharpBASIC interpreter/compiler is based on Thorsten Ball's Monkey
  language. But SharpBASIC is quite different and should be thought of as sort
  of a BASIC/Pascal hybrid, but more powerful than BASIC and less verbose than
  Pascal.
  </p>
  <p>The language is in its early stages. The interpreter works quite well and
  there are many working examples in the <code>/ex</code> folder.</p>
  <p>
  The main characteristic of SharpBASIC is that all definition blocks are
  marked by the keywords <code>OF..END</code>, while all execution blocks are
  marked by the keywords <code>DO..END</code>. Look at the <code>CONST</code>,
  <code>TYPES</code>, <code>IF</code>, <code>SELECT</code>, <code>FOR</code>,
  <code>WHILE</code> and <code>FUNCTION</code> examples to see how block
  statements are defined.
  </p>
  <p>
  See the <code>info.txt</code> file contained in the archive for
  information on how to use SharpBASIC.

      This is a simple implementation of the Monkey interpreter in Java. It is compatible with Java 5.0 or later (developed in Java 8, with -source 1.5 -target 1.5, compilation/run test in Java 5.0, 8, and 13). Released as single-file source code, the code is not beautiful, but should work. A compiled Java archive (Monkey.jar) is also available for those who donâ€™t want to compile themselves. Monkey.jar file is also compatible with Java 5.0.
      </p>
      <p>
      Need to run Monkey on older systems? Monkey.java can even be compiled in Java 5.0 running on Windows 95 (which was released in 1995). Monkey.jar (released version, compiled in Java 8) can also run on Windows 95. Running latest or released-25-years-ago operating systems? No problem, Monkey is always there.

  Langur is based on Monkey, but underwent many changes and has features you won't find in Monkey. Some of it's features include:
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
	    <li>arbitrary precision decimal floating point for numbers</li>
	    <li>integer basex notation for any base from 2 to 36, such as <code>2x1010_0010</code> or <code>-11x123A</code></li>
	    <li>highly expressive <code>switch</code> expressions</li>
	    <li>semi-integrated regex</li>
	    <li>ISO 8601 date/time literals</li>
	    <li>duration literals</li>
	    <li>automated for loop over a list, hash, or string, or over a range</li>
	    <li>first-order functions, including closures</li>
	    <li>immutable or mutable declarations</li>
	    <li>chained string interpolation modifiers</li>
	    <li>both truncating and floor division operators; also remainder and modulus, exponent and root</li>
	    <li>optional database operators (null propagating)</li>
	    <li>catching exceptions without explicit try blocks</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  Anthony Davis also wrote a book about how he implemented some of langur's features in a virtual machine that's similar to the one in <a href="https://compilerbook.com">Writing A Compiler In Go</a>. You can find the book and a free sample at <a href="https://opcodebook.com/">opcodebook.com</a>.

Started as Monkey but now is [GROL](https://grol.io/), on github [github.com/grol-io/grol](https://github.com/grol-io/grol) with following notable changes:
- redesigned the token/lexer/parser with intern'ing
- no need for custom hash function, go maps of interface can be used for exact equality checks
- removed `let`
- removed requirement for `(` `)` in `if`
- use numerical (uint8) enum (and stringer) instead of strings
- use said codes for checking type etc everywhere (or even pointer == check thanks for interning)
- added float, use `+` for concat of arrays and merging of maps, etc...
- formatting / normalizing the source code (try it at the web site "run" or cli `-format`)

{{< monkey-implementation "JoshuaHenriques" "cixac" "Go">}}
The Cixac programming language is a passion project that I decided to pursue with inspiration and guidance from Thorsten Ball's book. Creating this interpreter is the first (out of three) implementation of my object-oriented dynamic programming language.

{{< monkey-implementation "Javier-varez" "monkey_interpreter" "Go and C++">}}
Pretty much the regular monkey language, with a few customizations:
- Supports range expressions like `0..123`.
- Supports variable-length arguments to functions with `fn(a, ...) { }` syntax.
- Supports builtin functions to turn a vararg object into an array, like `fn(a, ...) { a + len(toArray(...)) }`.
- Support a `contains` builtin that returns a boolean indicating if a `Hash` object contains a key.
- Closures capture the environment by value, not by reference, making it truly functional.
- Implements nicer error reporting, giving contextual information of where the error happened.
- Apart from the interpreter, it implements the bytecode VM and a transpiler to C++, which turns out to be the fastest.
- Saves the repl history using `liner`.
